# Dames Italianes

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement the rules
- [ ] Make the grid
- [ ] Use sprites
- [ ] Allow in-game board rotation for better one-mouse versus.


## Rules
- 8x8 board
- Pawns move diagonally forward only, always in the dark squares
- If you reach the end, you become a dama
- Dames can move one step diagonally backwards as well
- Dames cannot be killed by pawns
- If you CAN take, you MUST
    - If you may take a pawn xor a dama, you must take the dama

- You win when you opponent has no valid moves
- Three-fold repetition exists
